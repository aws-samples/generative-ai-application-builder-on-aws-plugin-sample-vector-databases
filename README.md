## Steps to integrate a Knowledgebase for Retrieval Augmented Generation with Generative AI App builder on AWS.

The steps to ingest data into the knowledgebase and deploy the stack for the text use case is under Instructions folder.

The currently supported knowledge base are 

1)Amazon Opensearch text search
2)Amazon OpenSearch embeddings search
3)Neo4j Search

Choose the instructions for the knowledgebase that you would like to use from the Instructions folder.
